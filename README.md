smb token project

The SMB Token was created using the ERC-20 protocol and is the back bone of our echo system. 
There is a total max supply of 100 billion tokens. The SMB Token will help pave the way for 
future SMB development and projects which include but are not limited to a [SMBGE] "which 
will contribute to agricultual and green projects", and a minable token [SMBCE] "which will 
contribute to clean energy projects", other coins/tokens that will each have a specific 
purpose in the eco system.

When this project grows we aim to better the earth and its habbitants not limited to humans 
by contributing and donating to charitable causes.
